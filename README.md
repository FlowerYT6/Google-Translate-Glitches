# Google Translate Glitch Tester

This is a simple tool to explore some of the strange, unexpected, or creepy outputs that have historically appeared when using Google Translate with certain repetitive or nonsense inputs—especially with low-resource languages like Somali, Māori, or Yoruba.

## ⚠️ Content Warning

- Some translations may contain **disturbing**, **violent**, or **religious prophecy-like** messages due to quirks in how the translation AI handles unusual inputs.
- This tool is intended for **educational and experimental** purposes only.
- **Do not** use this to generate or share harmful content.
- As Google updates its translation algorithms, these glitches may no longer appear or may behave differently.

## How to Use

- Open the `glitchTester.html` file in a modern web browser.
- Click the **Run Glitch Tests** button to see the current outputs.
- Feel free to modify or add new test inputs inside the script.

## Why Do These Glitches Happen?

Google Translate uses a machine learning model trained on huge amounts of text data. When given repetitive or nonsensical input—especially in languages with less data—the model sometimes “hallucinates” and produces strange or eerie translations.

## Disclaimer

This tool uses an **unofficial** Google Translate API endpoint and may stop working if Google changes their service. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Google.
